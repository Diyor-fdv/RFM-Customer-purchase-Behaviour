📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates customer behavior analysis and segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework in Power BI.

The main objective is to identify high-value, at-risk, and potential customers, enabling data-driven strategies for retention, conversion, and revenue growth.

The analysis is based on the Adventure Works sample dataset, commonly used for business intelligence and analytics case studies.

🎯 Business Objectives

Segment customers based on purchasing behavior

Identify high-value customers for targeted marketing

Detect at-risk customers and design retention strategies

Convert first-time or low-frequency buyers into loyal customers

Analyze revenue trends across regions and products

📂 Dataset

Source: Adventure Works sample dataset

Domain: Retail / E-commerce (Bicycles & Accessories)

Format: CSV

Tables:

Fact Table: SalesOrderDetail

Dimension Tables: Customers, Products, Dates, Geography

The dataset was modeled using a Star Schema for performance and analytical clarity.

🧠 Analytical Approach
RFM Scoring

Each customer is scored on:

Metric	Description	Scale
Recency (R)	How recently the customer purchased	1–5
Frequency (F)	How often the customer purchased	1–5
Monetary (M)	Total spending by the customer	1–5

RFM scores were calculated at the customer level, not at the product level.
Products were used as inputs to measure customer behavior.

Customer Segments

Based on RFM scores, customers were categorized:

Segment	Description
Top Value	High R, F, M – high revenue & frequent buyers
Need Retention	High past value but declining engagement
Need Conversion	New or low-frequency customers with growth potential
No Action	Low value, infrequent buyers
📊 Key Metrics

Total Revenue: $20.06M

Total Customers: 19.12K
